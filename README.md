# aws-saac02

While working through the SAAC02 AWS Solutions Architect certification course, I am recreating all of the instructor's examples in Terraform to kill two birds with one stone.

## Useful Commands

```
aws configure
aws configure list-profiles
touch main.tf
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform fmt
terraform plan
terraform apply

## Credit

My friend/co-worker @Magentah recommended that I do this, so thanks to him!
@acantril for the informative course.
